### 1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test for Normality
**Results**:
- KF Normality *p*-value: 0.7045
- SVM+KF Normality *p*-value: 0.0352
- LSTM Normality *p*-value: 0.0021

**Interpretation**:
- KF: *p* = 0.7045 > 0.05. This indicates that the Kalman Filter RMSE values **are normally distributed**.
- SVM+KF: *p* = 0.0352 < 0.05. This suggests that the SVM+KF RMSE values **are not normally distributed**.
- LSTM: *p* = 0.0021 < 0.05. This indicates that the LSTM RMSE values **are not normally distributed**.

### 2. Friedman Test (Non-parametric Repeated Measures ANOVA)
**Results**:
- *p* = 4.49e-09 < 0.05. This shows that there is a **statistical difference** in the RMSE values across the three models (KF, SVM+KF, and LSTM).

### 3. Post-hoc Pairwise Comparisons (Bonferroni-Holm)
**Pairwise Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests**:
- KF vs SVM+KF: *p* = 0.0000, adjusted alpha = 0.0500 | **Significant**
- KF vs LSTM: *p* = 0.0000, adjusted alpha = 0.0167 | **Significant**
- SVM+KF vs LSTM: *p* = 0.0000, adjusted alpha = 0.0250 | **Significant**

**Interpretation**:
All pairwise comparisons between the models (KF vs SVM+KF, KF vs LSTM, and SVM+KF vs LSTM) are **statistically different**. This suggests that there are statistical differences in the RMSE values across the models, with all comparisons showing that the models differ in performance.

---

### Conclusion:
The **Kalman Filter** (KF) performs most consistently with a normal distribution in the RMSE values. The **SVM+KF** and **LSTM** models show statistical differences from KF and each other in terms of RMSE. All pairwise comparisons suggest meaningful differences in performance between the models.

**Notes**:
- These results were analysed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, Friedman test, and post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction.
- Data were collected from RMSE values per trial for each model: KF, SVM+KF, and LSTM.
